This is an inital work on UNIRAST format

The urftobmp.c program is a simple GNU C program which decodes an UNIRAST file to a bmp file per page.

It does not handle the Colorspace/Duplex Mode/Quality or Dots per Inches informations.

It has huge debug output, you should dump the output to a file or to /dev/null !

Thanks for http://alanQuatermain.net/ for its URF file partial decode.
