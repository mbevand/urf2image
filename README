This is an inital work on UNIRAST format

The urftobmp.c program is a simple GNU C program which decodes an UNIRAST file to a bmp file per page.
It does not handle the Colorspace/Duplex Mode/Quality or Dots per Inches informations.

The urftotiff.c program is a simple GNU C program which decodes an UNIRAST file to a multipage tiff packbits compressed file.
It does not handle the Colorspace/Duplex Mode/Quality informations.
It depends on the libtiff and creates a multipage file.

Thanks for http://alanQuatermain.net/ for its URF file partial decode.
